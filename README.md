CodingTracker is a straightforward console application built with C# that enables users to track their coding sessions. It offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing coding time records.

Features

Adding Coding Sessions: Users can add coding sessions by providing the date, start time, and end time of the session. The application automatically calculates and stores the duration of the session.
